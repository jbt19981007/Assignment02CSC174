	<h1>Future Plans</h1>

		<p>My future plans as of now are totally uncertain. I am thinking of graduating from college with a CS degree and working in industry for a bit as my first and default option. After that, I may want to return to school to get my masters or probably a pHD if I'm interested enough at that time. If I don't get a job however, I think I will go straight to graduate school to try and get my masters while working on securing a job during those years. I will also consider research as a possible career track and if I find it interesting enough, I may do a phd and become a faculty member at a University and do research.</p>
